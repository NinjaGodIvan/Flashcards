# Flashcards

This project is currently in development. This will be finalized around April this month. So hang tight!

Flashcards is a Java application where you can customize your own flashcards and their sets. You can use this app without having to write down any flashcards if your hands are too tired of writing words with a pencil.

Here are the features that you can expect from this app:

1. Create a flashcard set: You can start by adding a flashcard set to add any flashcards.

2. Delete a flashcard set: You can delete a flashcard set.

3. Create a flashcard: You can create a flashcard by selecting a flashcard set and filling out a question and an answer.

4. Edit a flashcard: You can edit a flashcard by selecting a flashcard set. After selecting a flashcard set, the screen will prompt the question and answer on textboxes for you to edit. If you decided to edit a different flashcard, you have to go back to the flashcard set selection.

5. View a flashcard. This is where you can view your own flashcards. After selecting a flashcard set to view your flashcards, the flashcard maker will be constructing every flashcards from the set. You can press "Previous" or "Next" to go through the flashcards. It also features a glossary where you can go to any flashcard within an instant!

INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW:

1. All questions of the flashcards are UNIQUE. Any question that already exists in the data is invalid. This prevents multiple duplications of deleting flashcards. If you enter a question that already exists, then you will be prompt to reenter the question. Making the same question but with different amount of non-leading or non-trailing spaces is VALID.

2. Every flashcard MUST include a question and an answer, or it's considered invalid. Both question and the answer needs at least one character.
